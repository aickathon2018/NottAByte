# Oh Park!
# Concept
* One of the major problems is the time spent circling the area trying to find a parking spot , leading to wasted time and traffic congestion by people slowing down their cars to find parking.
* By taking advantage of smart cities ,allow one to pre-book a parking spot using their license plate.
* Automated barriers that will be unlocked and free up the spot when the camera detects the correct license plate approaching it.


# Example use cases
* State goverment can use it to regulate traffic in busy areas. Consumers can use it to schedule their trip or check whether there's free parking available before driving to the busy area.
* Booking a parking in crowded shopping malls so that can guarantee parking 
* Allow private parking spaces to be used by other people in the surrounding area ,efficiently utilising free space
* Enforce private parking spaces so that only the relevant staff can pack there.
* Can also be used for paying parking fees automatically by charging the user based on the amount of hours parking , removing time spent at autopay machines.
